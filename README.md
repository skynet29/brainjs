BrainJS is a javascript binding library

A binding library is a library to bind a data model (methods and attributs of an object) to HTML elements. 

I started writting this library after my experience with other popular binding libraries like angularjs, reactjs and vuejs.
I love working with angularjs directive but writting your own directive to make component was a real pain.
React is really cool but there is no more separation between HTML, CSS and javascript code

To get started, see the examples on my codepen page https://codepen.io/collection/AKgVOW
